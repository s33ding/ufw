# Uncomplicated Firewall (UFW)

Learning a little about firewall on Linux with [HackerSploit](https://www.youtube.com/@HackerSploit).

[Introduction](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UncomplicatedFirewall)

The Uncomplicated Firewall (ufw) is a frontend for iptables and is particularly well-suited for host-based firewalls. ufw provides a framework for managing netfilter, as well as a command-line interface for manipulating the firewall. ufw aims to provide an easy to use interface for people unfamiliar with firewall concepts, while at the same time simplifies complicated iptables commands to help an administrator who knows what he or she is doing. ufw is an upstream for other distributions and graphical frontends.
